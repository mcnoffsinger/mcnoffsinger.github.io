            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a student at the wake early college of information and biotechnology. I take wake tech classes as well, including NOS-110, and HUM-110. I am a member of ready set app, speech and debate,<strong> NHS</strong>, and NTHS. These are all clubs in enjoy and have decided to devote my time to. I love programming in python, css, and html. I can use markdown, css, and html somewhat well, but python I am quite good at using. <br>  In the future, I hope to program professionally, using it to either analyze databases or create websites.</p>
